# 🖼️ Image Captioning with CNN + LSTM

This project builds an end-to-end image captioning system using a pretrained CNN (InceptionV3) for feature extraction and an LSTM decoder for generating captions.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **CNN (InceptionV3)** extracts image features.
2. **LSTM decoder** generates a natural language caption.
3. Tokenizer handles text preprocessing.
4. Combined model is trained on image-caption pairs.

## 📂 Dataset

You can use:
- MS COCO captions dataset
- Flickr8k or Flickr30k

Format: A `.txt` file where each line is:
